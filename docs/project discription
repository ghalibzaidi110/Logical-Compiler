Semester Project: Mini Language Compiler – Open-Ended Design
Objective:
To design and implement a small compiler for a domain-specific mini language of your own
choice. The project should demonstrate understanding of the six major phases of compiler
construction, from lexical analysis to code generation, supported by handwritten specifications
and a working implementation.

Project Requirements
1. Define Your Own Mini Language
Each group will propose and document a small custom scripting language designed for a
focused purpose, such as:
 Numerical pattern generation (e.g., Fibonacci-like, factorial-based, custom arithmetic
logic).
 Simple game scripting (e.g., movement or scoring rules).
 Basic data manipulation (e.g., string or array processing).
 Text-based story scripting or dialogue flow (mini DSL).
 Mathematical or logical rule engine (e.g., truth table evaluator, matrix operations).
Each team must write their own language specification, including:
 Syntax (BNF/EBNF grammar)
 Lexical rules (tokens, identifiers, keywords)
 Semantic rules and type system
 Example input and expected output

2. Demonstrate All Six Phases of Compilation
Students must demonstrate complete workflow with proper artifacts:
1. Lexical Analysis – token definitions and DFA construction (hand-drawn).
2. Syntax Analysis – grammar rules, parse tree or derivation steps.

3. Semantic Analysis – symbol table construction and type checking rules.
4. Intermediate Code Generation – three-address code or intermediate representation.
5. Optimization (Basic) – constant folding, dead code elimination, etc.
6. Code Generation – executable output or pseudo-code interpreter.

3. Implementation
 Implement the compiler in any language of choice (Python, C++, or Java preferred).
 Include a simple UI or command-line interface that lets the instructor test code
snippets interactively.
 The compiler should accept an input file in the designed mini language and produce
output accordingly.

4. Deliverables (final submission)
Each group must submit:
 Handwritten design documents for lexical, syntax, and semantic phases (charts, tables,
parse trees, etc.) For lexical, syntax, and semantic phases each team must submit one
handwritten artifact (scan/photo acceptable) DFA/transition table or regex grouping, at
least two parse-tree derivations, and a sample symbol-table fill-in with scope example.
 Printed code with annotations for each compiler phase. Git repository (or zip) with
source code and commit history.
 Demonstration and viva voice demonstration of their compiler executing at least 3
unique test cases.
 Short reflection (1 page): what you learned, what you would improve.
