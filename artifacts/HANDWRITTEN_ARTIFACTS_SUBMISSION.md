# Handwritten Artifacts - Submission Guide

## Required Handwritten Artifacts

According to project requirements, you must submit **one handwritten artifact** for each of the first three phases:

1. **Phase 1 (Lexical):** DFA diagram or transition table
2. **Phase 2 (Syntax):** Parse tree or derivation steps  
3. **Phase 3 (Semantic):** Symbol table with scope example

## Artifact Checklist

- [ ] **Phase 1: DFA Diagram**
  - File: `PHASE1_DFA.pdf`
  - Reference: `PHASE1_DFA_HANDWRITTEN.md`
  - Must be hand-drawn on paper, then scanned

- [ ] **Phase 2: Parse Tree**
  - File: `PHASE2_PARSE_TREE.pdf`
  - Reference: `PHASE2_PARSE_TREE_HANDWRITTEN.md`
  - Must be hand-drawn on paper, then scanned
  - Include at least 2 parse tree derivations

- [ ] **Phase 3: Symbol Table**
  - File: `PHASE3_SYMBOL_TABLE.pdf`
  - Reference: `PHASE3_SYMBOL_TABLE_HANDWRITTEN.md`
  - Can be hand-drawn OR typed/formatted
  - Must show scope example

## How to Create Artifacts

### Step 1: Review Reference Files
- Read `PHASE1_DFA_HANDWRITTEN.md` for DFA instructions
- Read `PHASE2_PARSE_TREE_HANDWRITTEN.md` for parse tree instructions
- Read `PHASE3_SYMBOL_TABLE_HANDWRITTEN.md` for symbol table instructions

### Step 2: Create Hand-Drawn Artifacts
1. **DFA Diagram:**
   - Draw on paper following the instructions
   - Include all states (q0, q1, q2)
   - Label all transitions
   - Mark start and accepting states

2. **Parse Tree:**
   - Draw parse tree for `Sum = XOR(A, B);`
   - Draw complete circuit parse tree
   - Label all nodes clearly

3. **Symbol Table:**
   - Create table (hand-drawn or typed)
   - Include all required columns
   - Show Half Adder example

### Step 3: Scan/Photograph
- Use a scanner or phone camera
- Ensure good lighting and focus
- Save as high-quality images

### Step 4: Convert to PDF
- Convert images to PDF format
- Name files as specified above
- Place PDFs in `artifacts/` directory

## Submission Notes

- **Format:** PDF files
- **Quality:** Clear, readable, professional
- **Naming:** Use exact filenames specified
- **Location:** Place in `artifacts/` directory
- **Deadline:** Submit with final project

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Use clean paper** - White, unlined paper works best
2. **Use dark pen/marker** - Ensures good scan quality
3. **Draw neatly** - Clear lines and labels
4. **Check completeness** - Ensure all required elements are included
5. **Test scan quality** - Make sure text/diagrams are readable
6. **Label clearly** - All states, transitions, nodes should be labeled

**Remember:** These artifacts demonstrate your understanding of compiler phases and are required for project submission!
