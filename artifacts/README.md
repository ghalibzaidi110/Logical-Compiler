# Artifacts Directory
## Hand-Drawn Compiler Design Documents

This directory contains references and instructions for creating the required handwritten artifacts for the Logic Gate Architect compiler project.

## Required Artifacts

1. **DFA_IDENTIFIER.pdf** - Deterministic Finite Automaton for identifier recognition
   - Reference: `DFA_IDENTIFIER.md`
   - Instructions for hand-drawing included

2. **PARSE_TREE.pdf** - Parse tree for sample statement
   - Reference: `PARSE_TREE.md`
   - Example: `Sum = XOR(A, B);`
   - Instructions for hand-drawing included

3. **SYMBOL_TABLE.pdf** - Sample symbol table with scope example
   - Reference: `SYMBOL_TABLE.md`
   - Example: Half Adder circuit
   - Instructions for hand-drawing included

## Instructions

1. Review the `.md` reference files in this directory
2. Hand-draw each artifact on paper following the instructions
3. Scan or photograph your hand-drawn artifacts
4. Save as PDF files with the names listed above
5. Place PDFs in this `artifacts/` directory

## Alternative: Digital Hand-Drawn Style

If you prefer, you can create these using a drawing tablet or stylus to maintain the "hand-drawn" aesthetic while working digitally. The key requirement is that they demonstrate understanding of the concepts, not necessarily that they are physically drawn on paper.

## Submission Checklist

- [ ] DFA diagram for IDENTIFIER (hand-drawn, scanned as PDF)
- [ ] Parse tree for sample statement (hand-drawn, scanned as PDF)
- [ ] Symbol table example (hand-drawn or formatted table, PDF)

**Note:** The `.md` files in this directory are references only. The actual artifacts should be hand-drawn and submitted as PDFs.
